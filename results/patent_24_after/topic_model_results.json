            "The topic is about the application of a control method device in a wind power plant, which involves secondary frequency modulation in the power grid. The device has a fan mechanical power model that is first established, and the relation between fan mechanical power and pitch angle is determined. A fan prediction model is then established, which is based on the wind field prediction model. The total objective function is determined, taking into account the minimum difference between pitch angles in fans. The pitch angle reference value is established according to the wind field prediction model, and the pitch angle target value is finally corrected.

            "The topic is about the application of a control method device in a wind power plant, which uses secondary frequency modulation in the power grid. The device is designed to improve the coordinated control of the power grid by adjusting the pitch angle of the wind turbine's fan mechanical power model. The model is first established and the relation between the fan mechanical power and pitch angle is determined. A fan prediction model is then established, which is used to determine the wind field prediction model. The total objective function is determined, which takes the minimum difference between the pitch angles of fans in the wind power plant. The pitch angle reference value is determined according to the wind field prediction model, and the pitch angle target value is finally corrected.

The method comprises steps for connecting wind power, solar photovoltaic power generation, geothermal energy, industrial waste heat power generation units, and industrial park microgrid mode. The system also includes a compressing storing hydrogen compressor, generating power high-temperature fuel hydrogen battery, exchanging heat generated hydrogen oxygen cooled heat exchanged high-temperature fuel hydrogen battery, and generates heat exchanging heat supercritical circulation heating supercritical medium heated geothermal heat exchanger times times pushing supercritical power generation unit to generate power supercritical heated times.",
            "The topic is related to the invention of a combined oxyhydrogen fuel cell power generation supercritical generator set that effectively solves the problem of energy waste and mismatching of renewable energy supply, by utilizing wind power, solar photovoltaic power, geothermal energy, and industrial waste heat power generation units in a microgrid mode. The system comprises steps for connecting these sources, as well as for decomposing redundant electricity and exchanging heat generated by the hydrogen oxygen electrolytic cell power consumption peak. The supercritical circulation heating supercritical medium heated geothermal heat exchanger is used to generate power, and the supercritical power generation unit generates power by pushing the supercritical heated times times times.",

The higher Fermi level position narrower band gap combination poly hexyl thiophene photocathode promotes carrier separation and ensures sufficient redox capacity, leading to high-efficiency degradation of azo dyes and solar energy chemical energy electric energy utilization for high-efficiency azo dye degradation reactions.",
            "This topic describes an invention related to a photocatalytic fuel cell for treating azo dye wastewater. The invention involves using a bismuth vanadate nanosheet array on a transparent conductive glass substrate as the photoanode, while a poly hexyl thiophene organic semiconductor film grows on the same substrate as the photocathode. The lower Fermi level position and wider band gap nanosheet structure of the bismuth vanadate nanosheet array ensure a stronger reactivity and better light trapping capacity, which improves the contact area with dye molecules in the organic wastewater solution. The higher Fermi level position and narrower band gap combination of the poly hexyl thiophene photocathode promotes carrier separation and ensures sufficient redox capacity for high-efficiency azo dye degradation reactions. The use of solar energy, chemical energy, and electric energy in the photocatalytic fuel cell allows for efficient degradation of azo dyes, realization of high-efficiency solar energy chemical energy conversion, and improvement of the overall efficiency of the process."

The theoretical basis for this method is established on the common tube multimachine gridconnected operation, taking into consideration the dynamic performance and shafting speed regulation.",
            "This topic is about a method and system for optimizing the operation of a hydropower station with one pipe and multiple machines. The hydropower station comprises a coupling shafting, multidimensional vibration, nonlinear mathematical model, gridconnected operation speed regulation, mathematical model, and a unit for establishing a multi-objective optimization function. The system takes into consideration the adjustment performance speed regulation, multidimensional vibration, dynamic performance of the shafting, and disturbance load distribution coefficients. The speed regulator control parameters unit optimizes the decision variables and utilizes a multi-objective optimization algorithm to obtain various pareto control schemes that meet the requirements. The invention establishes a theoretical basis for safe and stable regulation optimization operation of the hydropower station."

The assembly comprises a container containing feed liquor, a distillate collected container, a thermal contact compressor, and a negative pressure distillate container. The vapour produced from boiling the feed liquor is compressed by the compressor, and the condensed vapour is then entrained into the feed liquor using thermal energy returned from the distillate container. This process is designed to aid in the continuous distillation of feed liquor, making it more efficient and environmentally friendly.",

It involves a distillation assembly aid that continuously evaporates feed liquor using solar energy. The assembly comprises a container that contains the feed liquor, which is then evaporated using the thermal contact compressor. The vapour produced is then compressed, and the condensed vapour is used to enthalpy thermal energy and returned to the feed liquor.
