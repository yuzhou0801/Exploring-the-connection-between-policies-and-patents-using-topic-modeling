            "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Wireless Charging and Management System: A Comprehensive Solution for On-vehicle Charging and Remote Control\n\nIn recent years, the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has become increasingly popular for various applications such as agriculture, surveillance, and delivery services. To enhance the efficiency and convenience of UAV operations, we propose the development of a novel on-vehicle wireless charging and management system. This system consists of several components, including a solar panel-based wireless charging transmitter, a battery box mounted on the UAV, and an airport control unit for remote control.\n\nThe battery box is designed to house a rechargeable battery that powers the UAV, while the wireless charging transmitter uses electromagnetic resonance mode technology to wirelessly transmit energy to the battery box. The solar panel, which is integrated into the UAV, converts solar energy into electric energy for charging the battery. The airport control unit allows for remote monitoring and control of the UAV during charging operations, ensuring safe and efficient charging.\n\nMoreover, the system features a dismounting operation that allows for simultaneous rapid charging of the battery while the UAV is in flight. This enables uninterrupted operation for extended periods, without the need to land and recharge the UAV. The system also allows for real-time communication and interaction with the UAV mode, enabling operators to control the UAV remotely.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed on-vehicle wireless charging and management system offers a comprehensive solution for enhancing the efficiency and convenience of UAV operations. With its innovative features and capabilities, this system has the potential to revolutionize the way UAVs are used in various applications, leading to increased productivity and cost savings.",

            "The topic is related to the invention of a rotary electric heating system that utilizes a phase change heat accumulator. The system comprises a rotary joint, upper and lower end pipes, an upper end surface, a lower end surface, and a heat exchange pipe bundle with fins. The electric heating belt is installed on the upper end pipe, and the phase change material shell is sleeved onto the upper end pipe and upper end surface. The lower end pipe is connected to the rotating joint, and the belt wheel is installed on the upper end pipe. The heat exchange tube bundle with fins is connected to the rotating joint, and the upper end pipe is connected to a motor that provides rotating power. The bearings are sleeved onto the upper end pipe, and the upper end surface is connected to the motor. The heat exchange tube bundle fins increase heat convection, and the phase change process is improved, resulting in uniform heat storage efficiency. The electric heating belt assists heat storage, and the system can meet the requirements of different working conditions and use solar energy heat pump off-peak electricity.",
