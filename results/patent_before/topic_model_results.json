            "Title: Support Floating Photovoltaics by Inventing a Floating Body with a Bottom-Fixed Structure for Supporting the Solar Panel\n\nIn this topic, we discuss a new innovation in the field of floating photovoltaics. This technology is designed to support a solar panel installation using a unique structure that integrates a floating body with a bottom-fixed support system. This system is composed of a bottom-fixed support structure and a floating body that is equipped with a bottom-fixed solar panel. The floating body is designed to be installed at the bottom of the photovoltaic system, and it supports the weight of the entire structure.\n\nThe key feature of this invention is that it allows for a more efficient use of space in floating photovoltaic systems.

            "The topic is related to the development of a maximum power point tracking control method for wind turbine generators. The invention disclosed a method for calculating the steadystate optimal torque value of a wind turbine generator based on the maximum power point tracking control, which involves using the rotating speed of the highspeed shaft, unbiased estimation of aerodynamic torque, and obtaining an aerodynamic torque estimated value using an unscented Kalman filter. The wind wheel power coefficient and torque coefficient are used to establish a nonlinear equation, which is then combined with physical relations to obtain the aerodynamic torque estimated value. The wind speed is calculated using the Newton-Lafson method, and the real-time wind speed estimated value is obtained by updating the aerodynamic torque estimated value based on the wind speed standard deviation. The combined electromagnetic torque set value is limiting the change range and rate of change, and the combined electromagnetic torque is realized according to the rated torque value of the generator properties. The converter is used to realize the combined torque control, and the wind energy capturing device improves the wind energy capturing quantity. The wind turbine generator set working condition is improved by reducing the low wind speed and high turbulence.",

The device has a fan mechanical power model that is first established, and the relation between fan mechanical power and pitch angle is determined. A fan prediction model is then established, which is based on the wind field prediction model. The total objective function is determined, taking into account the minimum difference between pitch angles in fans. The pitch angle reference value is established according to the wind field prediction model, and the pitch angle target value is finally corrected.

            "This topic describes a method for generating electrical power using a hydrobased electric power generation system that comprises a hydrodynamic power generation assembly. The assembly uses kinetic energy, hydrostatic energy, and turbulent energy to generate power. The system also includes a water accelerator assembly, which consists of support structure, partially buoyant baffle panel members, and array baffle panel members having opening interpanel spacing flow passageway. The baffle panels are hydropower converters supported by a support structure that is operably coupled to a generator.

The system comprises various components such as a boiler, desulfurizing tower, organic Rankine cycle flue gas cooling and reheating boiler, inlet desulfurizing towers, and a connected chimney outlet flue desulfurizing tower. The flue gas generated from the combustion of the boiler is sent to the desulfurizing tower, where it undergoes the process of desulfurization. The organic Rankine cycle flue gas cooling and reheating boiler sequentially connected outlet flue desulfurizing tower subsystems are designed to remove pollutants and fine particles like cooperatively removed, saving water energy and removing pollutants. This system not only generates electricity from the flue gas waste heat but also performs desulfurization and elimination of white smoke plumes, making it an innovative solution for both electricity generation and environmental protection.",
